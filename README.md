   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Register your app with Firebase and add the Firebase configuration to a `firebaseConfig.js` file in the `src` directory.
   ```javascript
   // src/firebaseConfig.js
   import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

   import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   export const auth = getAuth(app);
   export const db = getFirestore(app);
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
